## Overview

The hermes-agent production tree at
`/home/serveradmin/.hermes/hermes-agent` is the live source for the
whole agent fleet: gateways, dispatcher, kanban engine, auto-decomposer,
watchers. It is a mutable git checkout. Workers that pick up a card
checkout their fix branch into the **production** tree, which silently
wipes whatever was on the previous branch.

This was the root cause of two confirmed silent-fix-loss incidents:

| Date | Lost fix | Source branch | Discovered |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-17 22:27 | human-gate eligibility + `hub_escalation` quarantine gate (t_8b48a01f / t_334f608b) | `fix/state-db-busy-timeout` → `fix/kanban-recompute-ready-blocker-gate` | 2026-09-23 |
| 2026-09-23 17:36 | the restoration itself (t_efc7769a, 4a18baa139) + its regression test (t_9f3c5d4a, 6067b5a712) | `fix/kanban-human-gate-and-quarantine-restoration` → `fix/respawn-guard-decay-t_cfbbb112` | 9 minutes later, in a hub audit |

`done` previously meant "the fix existed somewhere at the time", not
"the fix is in production". Every closed fix was provisional.

## Architecture

Three pieces, all in the canonical-deploy branch:

1. **Canonical ref.** `canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9` is the durable
   tip that the deployed tree tracks. Today its tip is `4f914e1d23`,
   branched from `fork/fix/kanban-recompute-ready-blocker-gate` (the
   prior de-facto canonical lineage) and merged with:
   - the gate-fix lineage (`4a18baa139` + `6067b5a712`),
   - the quota-cooldown split (`29bf7edfb5`, t_cfbbb112),
   - the interrupt-scaffold echo filter (`ed6dab63ba`),
   - this deploy-branch guard (`4f914e1d23`).

2. **Worker isolation.** Workers that need to do fix-branched work
   operate in `git worktree add` siblings under
   `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.worktrees/<task-id>`. The production
   tree's working directory is NOT shared with workers.

   **As of t_ff7d30cc the isolation is mechanically enforced**: every
   worker spawned by the dispatcher enters an unprivileged
   user+mount namespace where the production tree is `EROFS` at the
   syscall level. A worker attempting `git checkout`, `git switch -c`,
   `git reset --hard`, `git pull`, `git update-ref canonical-deploy`,
   `git branch -f canonical-deploy`, `git worktree add`, or a nested
   `unshare -Urm` + remount-rw escape is denied by the kernel, not by
   convention. The launcher carves out exactly this rw set (no more):

   - the dispatcher-provisioned worktree (the worker can write here),
   - `<agent_home>/.git/objects` (shared object store a commit needs),
   - `<agent_home>/.git/refs/heads/<branch-dir>` (ONLY the directory
     containing the worker's own branch ref, e.g. `wt` for a branch
     named `wt/<task-id>`; `refs/heads` as a whole is NOT carved out
     because a worker that can update arbitrary refs can move
     `canonical-deploy` to a different commit — the narrow carve-out
     refuses cross-branch moves while still letting the worker update
     its own branch ref via the standard git plumbing),
   - `<agent_home>/.git/logs` (reflog),
   - `<agent_home>/.git/worktrees/<this-worktree-name>` (this worktree's
     `index`/`HEAD` — carved out per name, never the whole `.git/worktrees`).

   **Caveats** (measured, not surprises):

   - Supplementary groups are lost inside the user namespace; local
     group-gated sockets (`/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/unix.socket`,
     group `lxd`) are unreachable from a sandboxed worker. Remote
     access is unaffected (docker on this host is already an ssh
     context).
   - `git fetch`/`pull` inside the worker's own worktree fails —
     `FETCH_HEAD` lives in the ro main `.git`. The dispatcher must
     provision the worktree before the sandbox exists; `hermes -w`
     from inside a worker is unavailable by design.
   - **Cron spawn path is now covered (t_102333c4).** The cron's
     `subprocess.Popen` at `cron/scheduler.py:3281` is wrapped in
     the same `unshare -Urm` launcher the dispatcher uses. The
     carve-out set is computed against the agent home's own
     `.git/HEAD` instead of a per-task worktree's HEAD (cron has no
     worktree): `<agent_home>/.git/objects` (shared object store),
     `<agent_home>/.git/logs` (reflog), and either the branch ref
     FILE (top-level branch like `canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9`) or
     the branch ref PARENT DIR (nested branch). The full
     `refs/heads` directory is **never** carved out — sibling refs
     stay ro, so `git update-ref refs/heads/<other-branch>` is
     denied even from cron. The agent home's working tree
     (`<agent_home>/app.py` etc) stays ro: a cron agent attempting
     `git switch -c cron-evil`, `echo x >> app.py`, or
     `git reset --hard` against the production tree is denied by
     the kernel (EROFS / EACCES).
   - Sandbox-safe `mount` exits with distinct codes (91=stage bind,
     92=prod bind, 93=remount-ro, 94=carve bind) so a worker log
     surfaces the first failing mount immediately.

   Configuration: `kanban.worker_isolation = off|warn|enforce` in the
   resolved config; `HERMES_WORKER_ISOLATION=off` env var as a kill
   switch. The gate degrades HONESTLY when the kernel cannot deliver
   isolation (no unprivileged userns, non-Linux host): the worker
   still spawns but a single warning fires once per dispatcher
   process, never a per-spawn flood, never a silent pretend.

3. **Self-enforcing gate.** `hermes_cli.deploy_guard.check_deploy_branch()`
   runs on every dispatcher tick. A wrong branch, detached HEAD, or
   missing repo emits a structured WARNING + stderr banner. Drift is
   never fatal from the dispatcher's perspective (a stalled board is
   worse than a drifted one), but the cron pump captures the
   banner within one tick window (≤ 2 minutes) instead of the
   multi-day window that hid the 2026-09-23 incident.

The companion drift watcher (polls `git rev-parse HEAD` between cron
ticks and alerts on SHA change) is filed as a child card for Ultron.

## Operation

### Verify the deployed tree is on canonical

```bash
cd /home/serveradmin/.hermes/hermes-agent
./venv/bin/hermes deploy-guard check
```

Exit 0 = match. Exit 2 = drift. The output names `expected_branch`,
`observed_branch`, `observed_sha`, `reason`, and `agent_home`.

### One-time setup for a new operator

```bash
./venv/bin/hermes deploy-guard init
```

Appends `HERMES_DEPLOY_BRANCH=canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9` to
`~/.hermes/.env` (mode 0600) if not already present. Idempotent.

### Promote a fix to canonical (Option A workflow)

```bash
cd /home/serveradmin/.hermes/hermes-agent
# 1. Worker already did the work in a sibling worktree:
#    .worktrees/<task-id>/ on a fix/* branch, all tests green.
# 2. From the canonical branch tip, fast-forward or merge:
git checkout canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
git merge --no-ff fix/<task-id>-<short-title>
git push fork canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
# 3. Re-point the deployed tree:
git checkout canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
# 4. Restart gateways so the next import resolves the merged tip:
bash /home/serveradmin/.hermes/start-gateway.sh
# 5. Verify on the deployed tree (acceptance must measure here):
./venv/bin/hermes deploy-guard check
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_db.py tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban_decompose.py
```

### Force the dispatcher to abort on drift (testing only)

```bash
export HERMES_DEPLOY_GUARD=strict
# The next dispatch tick raises DeployBranchDriftError.
# DO NOT enable in production — a stalled board is worse than a drifted one.
```

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `HERMES_DEPLOY_BRANCH` | `canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9` | The expected branch name. |
| `HERMES_DEPLOY_GUARD` | `warn` | `off`/`warn`/`strict`. See deploy_guard.py. |
| `HERMES_AGENT_HOME` | `$HERMES_AGENT` or `/home/serveradmin/.hermes/hermes-agent` | The working tree to inspect. |
| `HERMES_WORKER_ISOLATION` | `enforce` on Linux+userns | Emergency kill switch for the worker sandbox. `off` falls back to the worktree convention (no kernel-level EROFS). Read `kanban.worker_isolation` from the resolved `config.yaml` to set the steady-state mode. |

The deploy guard reads `HERMES_AGENT_HOME` first, then `HERMES_AGENT`,
then the default path. This layering keeps the gate usable inside
containerized deploys (`HERMES_AGENT_HOME=/var/lib/hermes-agent`) and
on the host (`HERMES_AGENT` set by `start-gateway.sh`).

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: every dispatch tick logs `[deploy-guard] DRIFT`

The deployed tree is on a non-canonical branch. Either:

- A worker checked out their fix branch into the production tree
  (the bug we just fixed — they should be using `.worktrees/`).
- An operator manually checked out a feature branch.

Fix:

```bash
cd /home/serveradmin/.hermes/hermes-agent
git checkout canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
```

If the deployed tree has uncommitted work (`git status --porcelain` is
non-empty), capture it first:

```bash
git stash push -u -m "pre-canonical-restore-<date>"
git checkout canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
git stash branch <branch-name>  # if the work should land
```

### Symptom: `hermes deploy-guard check` reports `detached`

A review worktree is checked out at the canonical SHA without a
branch ref. Either reattach:

```bash
git checkout canonical-deploy-t_7161d9a9
```

Or, if the detached state is intentional (a sandbox review), set
`HERMES_DEPLOY_GUARD=off` for that worktree.

### Symptom: `reason=missing_repo` or `reason=git_unavailable`

The deploy-guard cannot find a git repo at `HERMES_AGENT_HOME` (or
`git` is not on PATH). For a packaged install (no `.git/`), set:

```bash
export HERMES_DEPLOY_GUARD=off
```

For a misconfigured `HERMES_AGENT_HOME`, unset it and rely on the
default path detection.

### Symptom: dispatch tick returns `DeployBranchDriftError`

`HERMES_DEPLOY_GUARD=strict` is set. This is intentional (test
environments only). Production should always use the default `warn`.

### Symptom: worker logs show `[worker_isolate] degraded to off: ...`

The host cannot deliver unprivileged mount-namespace isolation (no
`unshare --user --map-root-user true`, non-Linux, or already inside a
user namespace). The worker still spawns and the carve-out convention
still applies; you lose the kernel-level EROFS backstop. Acceptable
on dev machines that don't ship the agent tree; investigate before
disabling on a production host. Set `HERMES_WORKER_ISOLATION=off`
only as a temporary kill switch, never as the steady state.

### Symptom: worker reports `Operation not permitted` on `/var/snap/lxd/...`

Inside the sandbox, supplementary groups are lost (`ogroups=` →
`nogroup` in the new namespace). Local group-gated sockets
(`/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/unix.socket`, group `lxd`) are unreachable
from a sandboxed worker. Remote access (ssh, docker) is unaffected.
Map the gid via `newgidmap`/subgid, or run that one op outside the
sandbox by setting `HERMES_WORKER_ISOLATION=off` for the task.

## Dependencies

- `git` binary on the host (the guard shells out to `git rev-parse`).
- The dispatcher (`hermes kanban dispatch`) as the integration point;
  every other CLI command is gated only via `hermes deploy-guard check`.
- The cron pump `/home/serveradmin/.hermes/scripts/kanban_dispatch_pump.sh`
  for visibility — the WARNING log + stderr banner land in the cron
  stdout that already gets delivered to ops channels.

  `cron/scheduler.py:3281`. Carve-out uses the agent home's own
  `.git/HEAD` (cron has no per-task worktree); working tree stays
  ro.

## Doc-in-commit Caveat

The Obsidian vault REST write path on this host has been returning
201 Created but not persisting since 2026-09-18 (LXC in-process cache,
t_f1551b54). This stage-file in the worktree is the source of truth;
a follow-up kanban comment + dispatch cycle will re-issue the wiki
page when the vault cache clears.
